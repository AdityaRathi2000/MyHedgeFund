# MyHedgeFund

Trading stocks is fun, but investing in companies that you believe in is a lot more fulfilling. However, researching stocks is hard. Looking at their income statements, competitors, insider trading patterns, etc. - it can all get a bit too overwhelming. I wanted to create a more streamlined approach, where I could get all the relevant information needed to make an investing decision in one place. Introducing, MyHedgeFund

# What will I be able to see using MHF

You will be able to see the company's sector, industry, financials, peer comparison, current affairs, insider trades, ETF involvement, some analytics and buy/sell recommendations and visualization of some of the data!

# How do I use it

Just download main.py, MHF_fundamentals.py, MHF_html.py and double-bubble-outline.png. Open main.py and appropriately edit the file path (the first line in the main function) to point to wherever you have downloaded the files to.

Then navigate to main.py from terminal and run it (Using python3 main.py). You will be prompted to type in the ticker symbol you are interested in (AAPL, MSFT, CAKE, BABA, etc.) and after a few seconds, you should see an html file open up with all the relevant information.
